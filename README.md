# Getting Started with Crypto Wallet

This mock project shows a user’s crypto-currency assets which are locally stored in a “wallet”. As this currently functions as a proof of concept, I've only built out functionality for the Portfolio section.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running it locally

Fist install the required node modules:

`npm install`

Create an optimized production build:

`npm run build`

If you don't already have the node module `serve` installed globally, run:

`npm install -g serve`

Finally, serve the built project and look for the reported port number:

`serve -s build`
